# Cowboy Courses Prototype

#### Welcome to the prototype version of Cowboy Courses

This is the prototype of an application created to scrape the [Oklahoma State
University course catalog](http://prodosu.okstate.edu/osup-bin/tsrvweb.exe?&WID=W&tserve_tip_write=||WID&ConfigName=rclssecttrms2osu&ReqNum=1&TransactionSource=H&tserve_trans_config=rclssecttrms2osu.cfg&tserve_host_code=HostSeventeen&tserve_tiphost_code=TipSeventeen)

It was originally called sissed because the online system is called SIS:
Student Information System. This is the first prototype version I developed
in Rails 2.x, using Ruby Enterprise 1.8.7.
